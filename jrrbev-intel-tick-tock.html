                            <p> What is the cheapest true quad core CPU (i5) from each tick/tock from Intel? Thanks! Sandy Bridge - 2400? Ivy Bridge - Haswell - Broadwell - Skylake. What happens to Intel's tick tock cycle now? I'm sure that they were just planning to take Skylake to 7nm but they would still be slower and have less features than EPYC. So basically _always_ having Leopard/Snow Leopard - Yosemite/El Capitan cycles. Not just once every few versions when the OS becomes bloated and carry a lot of tech debt with itself. When Intel releases a new processor in the tock phase, they are introducing a new microarchitecture. When they release a new processor in the tick phase, they are introducing a miniaturization of the most recently released tock phase. My question is, what are the differences in the types of improvements that these two different phases bring to the processor? What can we generally expect from a tock phase vs a tick phase? And of additional interest, what is it about those phases that introduce. 
It's has been a long year, with speculations, leaks, rumours, etc. The "Zen+" naming was considered controversial, it was in the official slides pointing out to what comes after the original "Zen". and here was the confusion where other slides came with "Zen2" amp "Zen3" as major architecture updates. but AMD never mentioned anything about what comes between these major updates. As users here and others I and several other users started to use the + designation to these minor updates. Could someone explain to me more precisely about this new way of approaching CPU designs, I readed a bit about it, but didnt understand much tbh, like what should we expect as improvements with each new generation, with this new approach. I'm honestly curious, how is AMD supposed to keep up with Intel/NVIDIA? Intel has a quarterly RampD budget of 2.927B (https://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/r_and_d_expense), NVIDIA at 329.00M (https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/r_and_d_expense), meanwhile AMD has to split an RampD budget of 241.00M (https://ycharts.com/companies/AMD/r_and_d_expense) between its CPU and GPU divisions. AMD's assets (https://ycharts.com/companies/AMD/assets) are also worth less than two quarters worth This kind of bothers me because it's basically a misquote/omission that no one bothers to correct if it's mentioned, and because it misrepresents just how many generations Intel had to spend on the Core architecture before it became the measuring stick that it is today. (Is 8700K a good replacement for my 2700K? .probably) ____ tl;dr Basically, the Core architecture descends from Intel's mobile CPU, the Centrino. It was developed by Intel's Israeli team while the main research 
Topic (Background) Intel Skylake M has already been released on a variety of Windows devices. However, given the fact that Apple has had a history of releasing the Mac refreshes based on the Intel "tick-tock", where every tick has had the refresh at WWDC and tock as a discrete update in Spring and Fall. Thesis/Questions - OPEN DISCUSSION Is the leap between Broadwell and Skylake worth waiting 5-6 months for? When can we expect to see a design refresh? Will the Macbook. -Why Zen uses a 14nm process made for mobile- (Low-Profile Process derived from Samsung) Lower Power Consumption and TDP - The Intel 7700k, a quad core with HT, has a 91W TDP, while the Ryzen 1700 is rated at 65W. Both at stock clock profiles. - The 6850K, a hex core with HT, has a 140W TDP. A Ryzen 1700x has a 95W TDP. - Similarly, the 5960X and 6900K also have a 140W TDP. The 1800x trades blows at only 95W rated. A smaller die size means more cores crammed in per processor. What is your intended use for this build? Gaming, as well as regular use (watching videos, writing documents, etc.) If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? Hoping to hit max settings at 144fps, at 1440p for most new games. I'm not sure how realistic this is- More on that below. What is your budget? Not a strict budget, but I'm going to try to keep it close to 00. I will spend more if it'll be worth the extra money. The monitor I have listed below Within the next 2-3 years, system builders are more likely than not going to be seeing a wide new range of Intel Processors as the company stalls to prepare for 10nm mass production starting in Cannonlake (Current gen processors Broadwell and on are 14nm with Haswell/Ivy Bridge being 22nm). Instead of the traditional Tick-Tock change, Intel will be adding, for the first Hello r/buildapc! I've always built my own PC's but it has been a while since I last did so. I built my current PC 7 years ago - the i7 920, 12GB (triple channel!) RAM, motherboard and case are the same from when it was originally built. The GTX760, SSD and PSU were fitted a few years ago after the old ones became horribly outdated or blew up. The PC is mainly used for 3d graphics work (max/maya/zbrush/substance/photoshop/illustrator) and some video editing/compositing (more after effects. Within the next 2-3 years, PC Gamers are more likely than not going to be seeing a wide new range of Intel Processors as the company stalls to prepare for 10nm mass production starting in Cannonlake (Current gen processors Broadwell and on are 14nm with Haswell/Ivy Bridge being 22nm). Instead of the traditional Tick-Tock change, Intel will be adding, for the first time recently. I am starting to get the bug to build a new PC. I have upgraded my GPU several times but have held off on RAM and SSD upgrades till I do a full new build. I never upgraded to an SSD in this PC because I am running a RAID 1+0 setup and thankfully this added complexity and redundancy will go away in the new build. Anyways, to the topic on hand. I am currently using an Intel I7-930 Nehalem/Bloomfield CPU. This was a Tock on Intel's development model. I suppose the tocks are more exciting 
I see Haswell recommended kinda as the default CPU on this sub (specifically the i5-4460). Why does no one recommend Broadwell CPU's, instead jumping straight to Sky Lake (other than the massively cooler name)? I understand it has something to do with Intel's "tick-tock" cycle but I'm not entirely sure what this means in a performance sense between the Broadwell and Haswell. </p>

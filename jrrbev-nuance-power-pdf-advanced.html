And, on a special side note.Every April Fool's. Hey there, thanks for clicking. So I was laid off Thursday afternoon and have gone through the pain of getting personal assets setup, had maintained my work computer for personal needs (non-nefarious) for years and all the sudden I'm without. I'd had Nuance Power Advanced on my work PC for years and honestly fell in love with the functionality. Being without income and having just bought a personal PC I'd rather not face the music of the 0 price tag for advanced, but still

Reddit is not allowing me to insert pics in this post and I am only allowed to post less than half of the original text. So if this information looks useful to you, I highly encourage you to download the full PDF. Preamble Note: This was originally a Quora.com answer but the modbots deleted it. Guess AI and interpreting policies. We just signed a volume license agreement with Nuance \~6 months ago and now they're raising the prices, though the retail prices haven't gone up. Anyone else have experiences with them? (We're also paying for maintenance, though now I'm questioning why.) It's for Power PDF Advanced. It's more principal than the amount of $ we're talking about. If there's 0 value to the volume license I'll stop w/this nonsense and just by individual seats. ##Editor's Note: To fulfill my promise from the charity drive: I read the first section of the Communist Manifesto in the original German and will provide commentary. It was not fun and you can feel like I've been suitably hazed. In this post, I read and provide commentary on the Communist Manifesto (in English, after reading it in the original German). I'm sure this will be linked to /r/badphilosophy, /r/badmarxism, /r/badhistory, /r/badeconomics and /r/badeverything. And of course ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded. All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm # Preface Nitecore seems to love the TIP series of lights. They’ve released a stainless steel version, and sent one out for me to review. I happen to like stainless lights, so I already kind of liked it from the start. # Official Specs and Features ( # Versions There are three colors of this stainless steel light. One is PVD titanium coated and one (or both of the others) is “mirror polish”. I have the PVD titanium coated versio. Today someone asked me about c744 so I come in here looking for my post  Of course, I completely forgot to post it. So here it is, just a wee bit late. I finished it a little over a week ago before taking a much-needed week off. I'm working on capstone. Anyway  If you're learning data analytics from scratch, this might be the part where you start to question your decision to attempt the degree. All I can say is, it gets better. Just chip away at various parts one step at a time. Expect. 
R1: I have been browsing r/GoodEconomics and came across this post(https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3sonfk/is_comcast_marking_up_its_internet_service_by/cwz896w) on why Comcast should be regulated. Having read this piece, what is missing here is a lot of history, regulation, and, yes, economic nuance both of networks and of IO. Part of the purpose of this post is to push back against a lot of things people tend to get wrong in this industry, but it is also to collect my thoughts. A wee bit of background is necessary today, my friends. A while back I wrote an essay lambasting some badhistory from a Catholic stan, and while my historical analysis was quite solid, my friends here noted it was rather unseemly of me to treat a random Redditor so harshly. /u/tachibana_taro in particular encouraged me to "pick on someone my own size," so to speak, and I thought that was a good idea! So for today's essay, I'll be taking on an actual published college professor: Edward Feser Hey guys! Once again, this is an xpost from /r/badhistory, because it involves Karl Marx, and it's always funny listening to bad politics involving everyone's favorite German santa claus. To be fair, the person I'm criticizing here, Ed Feser, is an actual professor at a college in California, so he's not as bad as random redditors or 4chan charts tend to be. Though he's a professor of philosophy, he commited a few whoppers of historical interpretation both in regards to anti-slavery politics. In the previous two part post, I attempted to disabuse Asians of the non-existent "post-racial" west where everyone can succeed if they work hard enough. You now understand that the game is rigged against you at every step of the way and there's a limit to how far you are allowed to succeed. Today's post explains how this world works instead of the fairytales that you're fed through the western-controlled mainstream media (MSM). I realize this is another "negative" post. I'm not writing these.
